# image-segmentation-using-wdo
Fully automatic Common Carotid Artery ultrasound image segmentation using Wind Driven Optimization technique
=============

## Code Details

- Image denoising and enhancement codes are not attached. 

- The code is tested on several Ultra Sound images and it can be used to segment other types of images with little modifications.

- Number of threshold levels have to changed according to the image to be segmented. Number of iterations or the population size has to be incremented to achieve better results.

- Here, Otsu's function is as a fitness function for finding the optimum thresold. The code for Otsu's function is attached.
