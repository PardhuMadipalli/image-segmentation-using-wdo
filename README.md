Fully automatic Common Carotid Artery ultrasound image segmentation using Wind Driven Optimization technique

Image denoising and enhancement codes are not attached. 
The code is tested on several Ultra Sound images and it can be used to segment other types of images with little modifications.

Number of threshold levels have to changed according to the image to be segmented. Number of iterations or the population size has to be incremented to achieve better results.

Here, Otsu's function is as a fitness function for finding the optimum thresold. The code for Otsu's function is attached.
